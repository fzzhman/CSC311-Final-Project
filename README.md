KNN Writeup:
  State the underlying assumption on itembased collaborative filtering: 
  Underlying Assumption:  The core underlying assumption is that if Question A is similar to Question B, then a student will score similarly on both Questions.

2 part (d):  Comment on the shape of the curves and briefly describe what these curves represent.
  As value of theta increases, probability of student getting the answer to question [i] correct increases.
